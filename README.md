### Hi there 👋

⚡ I am working as a junior fullstack developer at Siigo.

🔭 I am currently working on http://nordicco.tk/ freelance eCommerce project. This project is developed in Angular 9 with SSR and Spring Boot 2.3.2. Hosted on Amazon EC2, Amazon Linux OS, with containerization on Docker, uses Nginx as reverse proxy, also implements Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS services (MySql). On the other hand, the entire CI / CD is orchestrated by Jenkins, starting from a pipeline.


Programming languages with Frameworks:

    Java - JavaEE with JSF and Spring Boot
    
    JavaScript - Angular 
    
🤔I am interested in learning Flutter, Devops, GoLang and Mobile Development
