### Hi there 👋

⚡ I am working as FullStack developer at Siigo.

🔭 I am currently working on https://nordicco.com.co/ freelance eCommerce project. This project is developed in Angular 9 with SSR and Spring Boot 2.3.2. Hosted on Amazon EC2, Amazon Linux OS, with containerization on Docker, uses Nginx as reverse proxy, also implements Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS services (MySql). On the other hand, the entire CI / CD is orchestrated by Jenkins, starting from a pipeline.


Programming languages with Frameworks:

    Java - JavaEE with JSF ⭐⭐
    
    Spring Boot ⭐⭐⭐
    
    Net Core ⭐⭐
    
    JavaScript - Angular ⭐⭐⭐
    
    SQL ⭐⭐
    
    NoSQL (Mongo) ⭐
    
🤔I am interested in learning Kubernetes, Microservices, CI/CD, Golang, Vue + Vite and Design Patters. Why do I want to focus on having knowledge in Software Architecture.
